1. Each time a button is pressed the display will update
2. Like a normal calculator one should be able to for example press "12", the "plus" sign, and then when starting to type the second value the display should update to those digits.
    2.1 This would mean that only two sets of digits will be processed at one time.
3. There should be two variables which would take of the two values being calculated at one time.
    3.1 Another variable should contain the operator
    3.2 A last value should keep the running sum of all the operations.
4. When the "equals" sign has been pressed, the display should update with the sum.

1. Each button pressed should call a functon to update the display with that number
    1.1 the number is added to the existing content of the display
2. Each time an operator is being pressed the display clears
    2.1 The value that is in the display will be saved to value1
    2.2 If value1 is filled, then value2 will be filled.
    2.3 If value2 s flled then a calculation of the two values will be   done. This is saved in tempSum, the values must be undefined
    2.4 (Example 1) The logic continues on and if only one more number is entered after tempSum is filled
        2.4.1 Logic should be: Whenever the '=' is pressed:
            check if tempSum exist:
                check if value1 exists:
                    use the operator in operatorValue to calculate tempSum and value1
                    Display to display
                else (!value1)
                    display tempSum
